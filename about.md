I'm a software engineer working in Portland Oregon.

I have [a github](https://github.com/ZNielsen) where I do some things that are of interest to me.

### Tools I love
- vim - currently using neovim, which feels like the future of vim.
- tmux - multi tab and saves the session if your network craps out. What's not to like?
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) - A self-wiki. Notes that are just text files on your computer.

### Not a robot...
I love non-tech things too!
- Role playing games
- Board games
	- Some friends from work really pulled me into the table top board game world quickly.  Really enjoying all the new games I'm learning to play.
- Hiking
- City wandering
  - Portland (home city)
  - Seattle
  - San Francisco
  - New York
  - Amsterdam
  - Shanghai

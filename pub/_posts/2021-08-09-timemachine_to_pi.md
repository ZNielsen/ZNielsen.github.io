title: Remote Backups - TimeMachine to a Raspberry Pi
layout: post

I have a homemade "NAS" for long term data storage that is essentially just a hard drive plugged in to a Raspberry Pi. I recently made a change that required me to re-setup remote TimeMachine backups, which was a nice reminder of how awesome that feature is. Backups that just happen without having to remember to plug an external drive into my laptop :chefs-kiss: I love it. Not to mention that if I find that annoying, there is no way I can convince non-tech-geek members of the house to do regular backups. A networked solution is the way to go.

[Here is a link][1] to the guide I followed (you are welcome future me, now you don't have to track this down again).

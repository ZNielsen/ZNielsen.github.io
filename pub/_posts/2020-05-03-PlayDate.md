title: I'm Stoked for the PlayDate

I'm getting super stoked about the [PlayDate][playdate] after watching the [Panic Playdate Programming][ppp] stream on Twitch. I've had my eye on the PlayDate ever since [Panic Inc.][panic] announced it. A real dev friendly platform that isn't just a dressed up arduino. Most those arduino systems have a rediculously tiny screen and controls so small they can't be used for more than a minute. From what I've seen of the PlayDate screen, it looks really nice. The crank mechanism should also allow for some very unique gameplay.

I'm very much looking forward to exploring PlayDate's SDK. Unfortunately they havn't announced when that will be released, so in the meantime, [I'm learning Lua][lua post] and putting together some of the "engine" type stuff for some games I have in mind.

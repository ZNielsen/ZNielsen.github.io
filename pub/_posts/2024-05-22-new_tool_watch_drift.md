I finally got around to writing a tool that I've wanted to make for a year or so: [WatchDrift](https://github.com/ZNielsen/watch_drift).

I used to use [toolwatch.io](toolwatch.io) but found it annoying to click through a not-exactly-blazing-fast
website that occasionally makes you re-login just to see how fast a particular watch is running.
The hand rolled spreadsheet worked, but entering in a new measure start/stop time was a big pain.
This tool gives me everything I'm interested in with a much more ergonomic interface.

It's fun to be able to create things that fit your personal niche. I can't make a cabinet, but I can
make my own software tools.

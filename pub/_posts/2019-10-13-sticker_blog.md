## I'm Writing A [Sticker Blog](/blog/stickers)

I have been sticking stickers on my water bottle for a while now, and they are 
starting to cover each other up!  Documenting each sticker as I get them will 
help me remember all the stickers in the layers of color on my water bottle.

Each post should have a picture of the sticker, a description of it, how I came
by the sticker, and any stickers that is covers up.  I may try to do this in
some parsable way so I can make a sticker graph of some sort.

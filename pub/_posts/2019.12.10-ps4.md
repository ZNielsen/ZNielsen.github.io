I finally picked up a current gen console ([just in time for the next gen to
come out][1]).

This console generation launched when I was a freshman in college, and so I had
no disposable income to stay up to date on games.  I switched over to PC indie
games because they were cheaper and didn't require a beefy graphics card (which
I also could not afford).  Now that I can afford to spend some money, I was able
to capitalize on some Black Friday deals and snag a PS4 Pro bundle.

Wow.

I am very impressed with how smooth the whole experience has been.  Yes, there's
the immediate software updates, and yes, it's annoying to have to copy the game
off a disk before playing it, but compared to the headache that is managing a
gaming PC, the PS4 is like butter!  Instant power on, no controller headaches, and a much more comfortable play experience (I much prefer the couch to the chair I work in all day).

Now all that said, I still spend the vast majority of my gaming time on my computer. Most of the time when I'm playing games, I'm playing to spend time with my friends, and they all play League of Legends. However I suspect all my solo gaming time will be switching over to consoles.

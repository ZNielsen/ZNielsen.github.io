Recipe first, notes after

### Ingredients
- Gold Potatoes, 5 lbs, peel and cut into big chunks (usually quartered)
- Butter, 1.5 sticks
- Garlic 1 head
- Heavy Cream, 1 Cup warmed, plus more for consistency
- Sour Cream, 1 Cup
- Salt

### Instructions
- Peel and cut potatoes
- Put into a dutch oven
- Fill with water, make sure it is fully covered
  - 3cm+ of water over the potato level should be good
- Salt potatowater liberally
- Bring to boil (takes a while)
- Melt the butter on low heat
- Peel garlic
- Once fat separates from butter, remove if possible
  - should float to top, but Iâ€™ve had mixed results
- Smash peeled garlic with knife side and add to butter
- Low simmer for 15 min, then keep warm until potatoes are done
- Once potatoes are boiling, reduce to simmer and cook until fork tender, 20min+
- Drain potatoes, shaking the strainer to get as much water out as possible.
- Put potatoes back into dutch oven
- Add butter+garlic, warmed cream, and some salt
- Hand mash until combined
- Add sour cream
- Mash/mix until combined
- Add salt/pepper
- Add heavy cream to get up to the creaminess you like

## Notes
I peel the center of the potatoes and leave the skins on the endcaps. It's faster and gives you a touch of skins in the final mash.

If you want a less overpoweringly garlic mashed potato, remove and discard the garlic cloves from the butter after the 15 min simmer is done. But honestly, why are you even here then?

The hand masher I have is the [OXO Good Grips Nylon Potato Masher][masher], the rounded sides make it easier to use on the round side of the dutch oven.

If you want to make them look fancy, top with some paprika and chopped parsley. I usually go without.

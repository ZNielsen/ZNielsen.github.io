I came across [David Schell's][blog] blog via [John Gruber][df_link]. I enjoyed reading about Schell's experience interacting with conservative Christian culture. I am thankful to live in a city where I don't often come up against this kind of pushback.

I really enjoy his footnote about not necessarily standing by everything he has ever written. I think it's important to change your opinions as you learn.

## The Hardest Part of Gaming

Without a doubt, the hardest part of playing RPGs is finding a group.  There are so many things working against you.  The first step is finding anyone who actually plays RPGs.  Preferably, it's a group of people that you would enjoy spending time with anyway, but that certainly doesn't have to be the case.  You can bring friendships into games, or friendships can spring out of them.  In either case, you are left with the challenge of finding a good, consistent time to meet with your group.  After meeting all this criteria, you are left with the actual table issues: are you playing a game you like, is any player a table hog, do you have a pretty good GM, etc.. 

I just had a player drop, and now my group is hunting for another person to play with, preferably two.  I've never had a group last more than a couple of months.  I should have played more in high school when we all had nothing to do.

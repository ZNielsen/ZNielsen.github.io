# Black Lives Matter and the White American Church
What follows is not as structured as I would like, but I needed to get this out. It’s been stewing for a while.

My heart continues to be heavy regarding the treatment of black people in the country I live. The United States was designed from the beginning to enable and defend systematic cruelty towards a subset of human beings for the sole reason of making money. Wrestling with how I directly and indirectly benefit from that legacy (I’m white) has been uncomfortable for me. I don’t have a sweeping answer for what justice looks like, but I feel very confident saying all the “radical” things people are asking for in response to centuries of abuse does not even scratch the surface of justice; it barely even gets us to water-under-the-bridge-let’s-all-be-equals status.

I have a background with the American church. I was raised Christian and Republican, and it was years before I began to realize that being one did not mean you had to be the other. My nominal religious status is in flux right now, in large part due to the culture of “the church” (i.e. White American Christians). There are many examples of the hypocrisy of the White American Church, but in my mind none are more egregious, depressing, or enraging than how the church has responded to the cry from their black countrymen for justice and equality. I don’t think I will be able to put all of the thoughts I have had over the last few weeks here, but I will put some of the bigger ideas down. I’ll need to take this slow because I alternate between shaking with rage and choking back tears when I look at the church’s response to racism and systemic oppression.

I will make no arguments about the Christian Bible in a larger historical context, but I will lean on it heavily here because American Christians claim to do what the bible says. I think that is simply a lie that many American Christians tell themselves because actually following the teachings of Jesus is really inconvenient[^1]. Here are some things the book Christians claim to follow says.

### Love your neighbor
Literally the #2 thing to Jesus, only barely beaten out by "Love God". The pinnacle of human existence is love.

### Give him your cloak as well
The context of this is when someone robs you. A far cry from "when the looting starts, the shooting starts". If someone is desperate enough to steal from you, Jesus says you should go out of your way to help them, giving them even more money.

### I never knew you
"Look at all the things I did in your name"

### Yahweh hates an unjust scale
I don't know how you read the Christian Bible and not see that justice is a big fucking deal to Yahweh. Justice is hard. It's harsh. It's painful, unyielding, and at times brutal. Modern American Christians love to focus in on the grace side of Yahweh. It is not wrong to have a deep appreciation of grace. Grace is comforting and much easier to give a sermon about. But American Christians have totally taken the teeth out of justice. Perhaps because on some level they know that White American Christians would be the punishees in an an ungraceful application of justice. That should be a red flag, but it goes ignored.

### They will know by your deeds


## "They would kill him again"
A realization I had while thinking about how American Christians see

## Why Are Christians Not Christ-like
Without getting too far into it, I think this is in very large part a result of the Christian Church tieing itself to "The State". It started with Constantine and the HRE in the 4th century and just continues to be a problem, the modern version being American Christians tieing themselves to the Republican party in the 1980s.

Christians stopped looking to Christ for how they should treat others and started looking to Reagan/Bush/Trump/O'Reily/Hannity/Carlson.

## ~The~ My Response
This is such a big problem, it’s hard to know where to start. My prime strategy so far has been to seek out and listen to black leadership on the subject. One of the themes that keeps coming out is "this is a marathon, not a sprint". White Americans have the luxury of taking off this problem when it becomes too heavy to bear. Black Americans do not have that luxury.

As for practical personal responses, of course helping fund organizations that are focusing on justice and equality is non-negotiable. I cannot claim to care about something and then refuse to provide the only resource that gets anything done in a country as greedy as the United States (yes, that resource is money). But neither can we stop there, because many are affluent enough to toss some money away as a “make my conscience less guilty” tax, then continue to live lives unaffected by the radical injustice they just donated to stop.
As for actual actions, I don’t feel capable of any great feats in this realm, but I will commit to do what I can do. I have committed to not back down from these tough conversations when they come up; to be the voice in a group of white Americans who can try to provide any amount of perspective on the matter (woefully incomplete as it is, having not been forced to experience injustices first hand). This doesn’t sound like a big sacrifice, because it’s not. This is the least I can do while I keep an eye out for other actions I can take. All it requires is me making myself uncomfortable, learning, listening, and not backing away from a difficult conversation for the sake of social cohesion.
Much of the time I am talking with older, affluent, white Americans who have not been touched by any part of this. The dominating feeling I get from them is confusion. Some questions I have heard and stepped in to talk about:
- “Why are these protests happening?”
- “Why are they happening now, why not before?”
- “It’s not really that bad, is it?”
- “I never thought of \_\_\_\_ as racist, is it racist now?”
Ironically, I've been leaning heavily on my childhood apologetics training to handle these conversations. Step 1 of apologetics is study your shit so you know what you are talking about, so that's what I'm continuing to do.

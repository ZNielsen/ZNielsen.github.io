I finally picked up a current gen console ([just in time for the next gen to
come out][1]).

This console generation launched when I was a freshman in college, and so I had
no disposable income to stay up to date on games.  I switched over to PC indie
games because they were cheaper and didn't require a beefy graphics card (which
I also could not afford).

I had the opportunity to go on a business trip to Shanghai for 2 weeks.  It was
a blast!  The people I went with had been many times, so they were able to show
me the ropes and take me out to some pretty great restaurants.  It surprised me
to learn that there is an up and coming beer scene here that is very reminicant
of Portland.  Portland brewers have been moving to Shanghai to set up shop, and
the influence shows.  Here is the list of restraunts we went to, and the
food/drink I had at each place.

#### Blue Frog
This was day zero in Shanghai - jet lagged and tired.
- Food: **Burger** - In China you order medium well and you end up with something
  redder than you could legaly be served in the states.  I'll be ordering well
  done from now on.
- Beer: **Goose IPA** - This was nothing like any IPA I have had before, and not
  in a good way.  This was much closer to a sour.  Add that to the nausea I was
  feeling from lack of sleep, and this beer went almost entirely unfinished.

#### Tiantai
#### Disneyland
#### Din Tai Fung
#### Pistolara's
#### Boxing Cat
#### The Brew at Kerrys Hotel
#### Donghu

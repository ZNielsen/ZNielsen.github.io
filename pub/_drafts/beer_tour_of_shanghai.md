I had the opportunity to go on a business trip to Shanghai for 2 weeks.  It was
a blast!  The people I went with had been many times, so they were able to show
me the ropes and take me out to some pretty great restaurants.  It surprised me
to learn that there is an up and coming beer scene here that is very reminiscent
of Portland.  Portland brewers have been moving to Shanghai to set up shop, and
the influence shows.  Here is the list of restaurant we went to, and the
food/drink I had at each place.

#### Blue Frog
This was day zero in Shanghai - jet lagged and tired.
- Food: **Burger** - In China you order medium well and you end up with something
  redder than you could legally be served in the states.  I'll be ordering well
  done from now on.
- Beer: **Goose IPA** - This was nothing like any IPA I have had before, and not
  in a good way.  This was much closer to a sour.  Add that to the nausea I was
  feeling from lack of sleep, and this beer went almost entirely unfinished.

#### Tiantai
Day one, still quite tired and a bit nauseous.  Ended up at a Thai restaurant
about a mile walk from the hotel.
- Food: **Red Curry w/ Beef** - Quite good!  I went with the beef because the
  chicken tends to come bone-in, and I didn't feel like dodging them.
- Beer: **Dunkle Weisse** - Not a huge beer selection at this place.  Looking
  back, I probably should have gone with a Tsingtao considering how I felt at
  the time, but went with the dark beer instead.  It was good, I just wasn't in
  the mood for dark.

#### Disneyland
This was my birthday and we had the day off work, so I treated myself to a trip
to the Shanghai Disneyland.  It was a great day of wandering this smaller park.
Park food wasn't notable, and no beer was had.
- Food:
    - Lunch: **Noodles and Beef** à la Jack Sparrow.
    - Dinner: **Burger + Fries** à la The Avengers.

#### Din Tai Fung
Din Tai Fung has many locations, and just recently expanded to downtown
Portland.  I have not been to that location, so I can't compare how the American
versions hold up to the "authentic" ones, but this place was damn good.
- Food: **Dumplings** (duh) - 3x flavors of dumplings (crab, pork, chicken) +
  a starter of cooked spinach.  These came out _very_ hot, and I nearly burned
  myself on the first one.  Thank god one of the people with me warned me at the
  last minute about the "soup" - the near-boiling oil that was shed from the
  meat during the steaming process.
- Beer: Tsingtao - My first Tsingtao (the staple beer of China).  I had heard
  a lot about them from
  everyone who had ever been to China.  It was actually much better than I was
  expecting, and I much prefer it to something like a PBR, but that may be a
  product of the environment as much as the beer.

#### Pistolara's
Taco Tuesday!  A Mexican restaurant within walking distance of the hotel.  This
is a place of lore at Tektronix, and I have heard many stories about the
margaritas...
- Food: **Chicken Fajita Burrito** - As with almost every Taco Tuesday I attend,
  I forwent the tacos and went with a burrito.  I just love burritos too much to
  pass them up.  As burritos go, this one was fine, not great.  Impeccably
  wrapped though, maybe the tightest wrapped burrito I've ever had.
- Beer: No beer!  **Strawberry Frozen Margarita** - I didn't order this.  One of
  the guys turned to me and asked if I would kill a pitcher with him.  This was
  extremely tequila-forward for a frozen marg, and both of us were feeling
  pretty happy by the bottom of the pitcher.

#### Boxing Cat
The first micro brewing place we attended, and one of the oldest in Shanghai
reaching back to 2008.
- Food: **Grittle Mac+Cheese**
- Beer: **Breast Wishes Milk Stout** and **Sucker Punch Pale Ale**, along with a
  shared taster flight.

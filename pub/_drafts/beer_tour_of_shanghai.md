I had the opportunity to go on a business trip to Shanghai for 2 weeks.  It was
a blast!  The people I went with had been many times, so they were able to show
me the ropes and take me out to some pretty great restaurants.  It surprised me
to learn that there is an up and coming beer scene here that is very reminiscent
of Portland.  Portland brewers have been moving to Shanghai to set up shop, and
the influence shows.  Here is the list of restaurant we went to, and the
food/drink I had at each place.

## Friday - Blue Frog
This was day zero in Shanghai - jet lagged and tired.
- Food: **Burger** - In China you order medium well and you end up with something
  redder than you could legally be served in the states.  I'll be ordering well
  done from now on.
- Beer: **Goose IPA** - This was nothing like any IPA I have had before, and not
  in a good way.  This was much closer to a sour.  Add that to the nausea I was
  feeling from lack of sleep, and this beer went almost entirely unfinished.

## Saturday - Tiantai
Day one, still quite tired and a bit nauseous.  Ended up at a Thai restaurant
about a mile walk from the hotel.
- Food: **Red Curry w/ Beef** - Quite good!  I went with the beef because the
  chicken tends to come bone-in, and I didn't feel like dodging them.
- Beer: **Dunkle Weisse** - Not a huge beer selection at this place.  Looking
  back, I probably should have gone with a Tsingtao considering how I felt at
  the time, but went with the dark beer instead.  It was good, I just wasn't in
  the mood for dark.

## Sunday - Disneyland
This was my birthday and we had the day off work, so I treated myself to a trip
to the Shanghai Disneyland.  It was a great day of wandering this smaller park.
Park food wasn't notable, and no beer was had.
- Food:
    - Lunch: **Noodles and Beef** à la Jack Sparrow.
    - Dinner: **Burger + Fries** à la The Avengers.

## Monday - Din Tai Fung
Din Tai Fung has many locations, and just recently expanded to downtown
Portland.  I have not been to that location, so I can't compare how the American
versions hold up to the "authentic" ones, but this place was damn good.
- Food: **Dumplings** (duh) - 3x flavors of dumplings (crab, pork, chicken) +
  a starter of cooked spinach.  These came out _very_ hot, and I nearly burned
  myself on the first one.  Thank god one of the people with me warned me at the
  last minute about the "soup" - the near-boiling oil that was shed from the
  meat during the steaming process.
- Beer: Tsingtao - My first Tsingtao (the staple beer of China).  I had heard
  a lot about them from
  everyone who had ever been to China.  It was actually much better than I was
  expecting, and I much prefer it to something like a PBR, but that may be a
  product of the environment as much as the beer.

## Tuesday - Pistolara's
Taco Tuesday!  A Mexican restaurant within walking distance of the hotel.  This
is a place of lore at Tektronix, and I have heard many stories about the
margaritas...
- Food: **Chicken Fajita Burrito** - As with almost every Taco Tuesday I attend,
  I forwent the tacos and went with a burrito.  I just love burritos too much to
  pass them up.  As burritos go, this one was fine, not great.  Impeccably
  wrapped though, maybe the tightest wrapped burrito I've ever had.
- Beer: No beer!  **Strawberry Frozen Margarita** - I didn't order this.  One of
  the guys turned to me and asked if I would kill a pitcher with him.  This was
  extremely tequila-forward for a frozen marg, and both of us were feeling
  pretty happy by the bottom of the pitcher.

## Wednesday - Boxing Cat
The first micro brewing place we attended, and one of the oldest in Shanghai
reaching back to 2008.  The glasses here are great; narrower ridged bottom
leading to a bulbous top.  They reminded me of boxing gloves.  Not sure if
that was by design, or if I'm reading into the theme of the place.
- Food: **Grittle Mac & Cheese** - Very good, very creamy al dente noodles.
- Beer: **Breast Wishes Milk Stout** on nitro and **Sucker Punch Pale Ale**,
  along with a shared taster flight.

  The milk stout was creamy like a Guinness, but with a different flavor
  profile that I actually liked a lot better.

  Sucker punch pale ale was richer than I was expecting, almost like a red.  Had
  a great after taste that stayed with you for a while.

  Taster consisted of:
  - Sucker Punch Pale Ale - Really great pale ale with lasting aftertaste.
  - TKO IPA - A bit more fruity than your average IPA, but not crazy.
  - Money Shot Cream Ale - I want to love cream ales because they sound good,
    but I just don't.  I find them to bland, and this one was no exception.
  - King Louie Imperial Stout - Very complex stout.  Fantastic as a taster, but
    I passed on the full glass because there was so much going on.
  - Spiced Pumpkin Ale - Very pumpkin.  One in our group loved this one.  Good
    as a novelty/seasonal drink, but only for a bit of fun.
  - _One more I can't rember, but I think it was a pilsner_

## Thursday - The Brew at Kerry Hotel
Coming off of Boxing Cat, we were a bit disappointed by these beers.
- Food: **Spicy Seafood Linguini** -
- Beer: **The House Amber** - Nothing super noteworthy about this beer.  We had
  a taster flight that consisted of:
    - Dry cider - Extreamly dry.  Almost tasted like a dry white wine.
    - Pilsner
    - Another pilsner - Both pilsners were too light for my tastes.
    - cloudy hef-style - Pretty good, but again, a little light.  Super white in
      color.
    - Fruity IPA - A bit too fruity for me, but the others at my table liked it.
    - House Amber - A nothing special amber.
    - House Dark - A nothing special porter.

## Friday - The Flying Fox
This was an Irish pub right across the street from our hotel.  We met here for
a drink as we were waiting for our group to gather up.
- Food: None
- Beer: **Guinness** - I forget how good a Guinness can be.

## Friday - Shanghai Brewery: Donghu
I lost track of where this was, as I was jammed in the back of a taxi.  This was
a 'modern' club/bar, with a DJ and a small dance floor.  DJ favored '90s/'00s
mixes that were really fun.
- Food: **Spicy Burger** - I learned from the Blue Frog and ordered my meat well
  done.  The burger came rare (which is actually what I prefer in the States).
  At least I didn't have to worry about poisoning this time.
- Beer: **Unfiltered IPA** - Really good, not overly hoppy IPA.  I'm a sucker
  for cloudy beers, so I was all over this one.  Happy hour was
  2 for 1, so we all doubled up on drinks.

## Saturday - Big Bamboo
Super casual dinner with just two of us.  We were pretty tired, so it was a low
key evening.
- Food: **Lasagnia** - Fine.  Would not get again.
- Beer: **Beast in the East Pale Ale** - I also had a taster of the "No Pout
  Stout" - extremely
  rich, almost chalky texture.  Again, a stout that is a great taster but I
  would not want a pint of.

## Sunday - Chinese x4
Over the weekend, we were out on a company trip.  The meal locations were picked
for us, and they were all Chinese loctaions.  Most drinks were Sprite/Pepsi.
Dinners had Tsingtou and "White Wine", which is a high proof rice-based alchohol.
Tastes reminiciant of whiskey, but certainly wasn't whiskey.
- Food: Chinese
- Beer: **Tsingto + White Wine**

## Sunday - Karaoke Bar
Sunday night we ended up at a karaoke bar for some late night drinking.  The
whiskey was a whiskey/tea mix that was actually very good.
- Beer: **White Paulener + Whiskey & Tea**

## Monday - Pistolara's
We all were feeling something comfortable on Mondy, so we headed out for Mexican
food.
- Food: **Burrito**
- Beer: No beer, **Mango then Strawberry marg**

## Tuesday - Paulener
Tuesday we did a tour of the fake market, then headed down to the waterfront to
the Paulener - a German pub.  Atmosphere was great.  Long tables, Christmas
decorations up super early, music, ect.  We ended up all getting steins of
lager which was quite good.
- Food: **Venison stew** - Very good!  One of my favorite meals that I had on the trip.
- Beer: **Paulener Lager**

## Wednesday - Hutaoli
Our last day in Shanghai.  We went out for a goodbye dinner, capping the trip
with a solid asortment of Chinese food.
- Food: Various Chinese food
- Beer: **Corona** - Not a huge beer selection here, it was either Corona or
  Budweiser.

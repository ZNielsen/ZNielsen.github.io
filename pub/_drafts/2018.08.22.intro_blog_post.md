Setting up email on my own domain
=================================

Today I finally bought my first domain.  It was something I had wanted to do for a while, but for various reasons I had never gotten around to it.  At first it was because I just didn't want to pay an annual fee for something I didn't know what I was going to do with.  Then I had choice paralysis; if I decided to use this domain for email, I would be in it for the long haul.  I know what it feels like to be stuck with an email name that you didn't like anymore.  I still use an email that I set up 10 years ago.

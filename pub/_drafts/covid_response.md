>Read and saved this a few months ago. I still feel the same way about it. Read on....

I'm concerned that this is your point of view. I'm going to go through and share some answers to questions and why this is concerning to me.

>Now that we are going on month 6 of this "COVID" , I believe this statement from an ER nurse hits the nail on the head:

I shouldn't have to say this, but just because someone says they are an ER nurse doesn't mean they are. This sounds like someone leveraging the credibility of a field of work we know is on the front lines. Maybe they are a nurse, I can't say, but don't trust people on the internet just because they say they hold some position of authority.

>Please just take politics out of it and read this with an open mind using common sense.

I feel like this is a common opening line for conservatives who don't want to do any research. "Common sense" is a good starting point, but lots of truth is true while being confusing, hard to understand, or downright nonsensical. [1] [2] [3]

>Anyone out there who can tell me what our end game is with the covid 19?

Yes, a vaccine. [4]

>What is the magic formula that is going to allow us to sound the all clear?

The vaccine. Not magic, rigorous, expensive science. [4]

>Is it zero cases?
>The only way that will happen is if we just stop testing and stop reporting.

While not strictly speaking correct [5], odds are that we will not be able to fully stomp out SARS-COV-2 (much like SARS-COV-1 [6]). However, we don't have any kind of a handle on SARS-COV-2 yet. Many viruses require a vaccination rate of a little over 50% to drag their R0 value below 1. It's estimated that SARS-COV-2 will need a much higher rate because it is so contagious.

>Is it a vaccine?

Yes

>It took 25 years for a chicken pox vaccine to be developed.

The reason it takes so long to make a vaccine is because it is VERY EXPENSIVE. I'm thankful we have altruistic way-too-weatlthy-people like Bill Gates and others who were willing to flush billions of dollars down the toilet to develop vaccines in parallel, knowing nearly all of them will fail and be a waste. (side opinion - we should not have to rely on people's personal wealth for stuff like this. Nobody should be that rich.)

25 years? Well we did it in 7 months.
(Information on the vaccine process [7])

>The smallpox inoculation was discovered in 1796 the last known natural case was in 1977.
>We have a flu vaccine that is only 40 to 60% effective and less than half of the US population choose to get one, and roughly 20,000 Americans will die of the flu or flu complications.

These vaccines are >90% effective! [4] Which is insane.

I've seen people tout this number out before, and it just shows that they can't comprehend numbers at a large scale (humans can't, our brains aren't built for that). Breaking it down so the numbers are similar helps me. 20,000 people a year die of the flu. It takes about 13 DAYS for that number to die of covid. If you had the choice of two jobs, one paid $20,000 a year and one paid $1,500 per day (nearly $550,000 a year), I would not consider those jobs in the same way. Policies that help someone on food stamps probably aren't the most effective for aiding/managing a corporate executive. (I'm using the roughly median number on this chart. During spikes (like we are in now) the daily death rate is doubled [8])

This whole argument also discounts the fact that SARS-COV-2 is WAY more contagious than the flu [9]

>Oh, you'll mandate it, like other vaccines are mandated in order to attend school, travel to some foreign countries, etc.
>We already have a growing number of anti vaxxers refusing proven, tested, well known vaccines that have been administered for decades but aren’t necessarily safe!
>Do you really think people will flock to get a fast tracked, quickly tested vaccine, whose long term side effects and overall efficacy are anyone's best guess?

I aggree with this person's general point that anti-vax (and anti-science) sentimant is a dangerous and growing problem for a functioning society. Specilization is what makes civilization work. I also agree with Socrates - democracy is only as good as the education system that surrounds it [10] (especially salient youtube clip [11]).

I also understand the nervousness around taking a fasttracked vaccine. That doensn't sit the best with me either. The good news is the list of side effects are just the typical vaccine culprates [12], and the only intense reacations we have seen so far were in people who seem to have a propensity for anaphylaxis (they recovered) [14]. This is easily midigated by having an epipen on site for each vaccination (though, still quite scary for the recipients) (see non-alturistic rich people story [13]). Front line workers, once again, are bailing us out here. By the time we are able to get the vaccine, millions of front line workers will have gotten it, and the effects will be much better known. We've come a long way from injecting cow pus [20].

>How long are we going to cancel and postpone and reconsider?
>You aren't doing in person school until second quarter?
>What if October's numbers are the same as August's?
>You moved football to spring?
>What if next March is worse than this one was?
>When do we decide quality of life outweighs the risks?

I know this was written a while ago, so you can just shift all these arguments forward by a couple months. I would say now that we have the vaccine, the nebulousness has been severely reduced. These arguments are no longer about not knowing what the future holds, but just being impatient (they kinda always were). "I don't like staying at home and I don't care if that means someone I don't know dies". That's not a team I want to be on.


>I understand Covid can be deadly or very dangerous for SOME people, but so are strawberries and so is shellfish.

People can choose to not eat shrimp. They can't choose not to get yelled at about masks by an entitled infected person while they are working their job so they can make rent. These things aren't even comparable. This is a bad faith argument (another common tool of conservative fear mongering).

>We take risks multiple times a day without a second thought.
>We know driving a car can be dangerous, we don't leave it in the garage.

Agreed. We should allocate more government resources into self driving cars to save lives.

>We know the dangers of smoking, drinking and eating fried foods, we do it anyway.

Yes, people can choose to do things to themselves that are not healthy. I'm still going to be pissed if someone blows a bunch of smoke in my face. Once again, the vector of death here is so different than in a contagious disease that I don't think this is a valid comparison.

>We speed, we don't buckle our seatbelts, we take more than directed.
>Is hugging Grandma really more dangerous than rush hour on the freeway?
>Is going out with friends after work more risky than 4 day old gas station sushi?

What the fuck? Yes, it is.

16 mil infected / 330 mil in the US is about a 5% chance any individual has COVID. At a death rate of about 10% for grandparents [18], assuming 50% likelyhood of transmission (very low) that puts the rough likelyhood of any one off hug killing grandma at .25% - 1 in 400 hugs kills. Again, this doesn't consider if your grandma goes and plays bridge and infects half of the people she plays with.

1 in 4 car accidents occur during rush hour, with 0.7% of accidents being fatal. At an estimated 6 million accidents per year, that gives us 29 fatal rush hour accidents per day. Four a coarse comparison, that gives each American a 0.0000087% chance of dying in rush hour each day (no external factors taken in -> 1 in 11,500,000 rush hour days kills.

The only thing I could find on sushi deaths was about fugu [17], which isn't legal to serve except with a license. So not anything you are getting at a gas station. So I guess that goes to 0% death?

This is easy stuff, either this person is too lazy to do the math on their absurd statement, in which case I question how well thought out any of their arguments are, or they are incapable of doing the research, in which case nothing they say on matters this heavy should be taken seriously [10].

>Or operating a chainsaw?

Easily googleable, yes it is [16]

>When and how did we so quickly lose our free will?

Wow that came out of nowhere. Another conservative talking point that I don't think makes much sense. Put aside the argument that there is no free will (which has more merit than it first sounds, even if I don't subscribe to it [15]). You are not free to shoot someone in the back (unless you are a cop, in which case have at it [21]). Where is the outcry against that infringement on your free will? IMO this is thrown out because it riles people up, but the logical consequence of the argument is never thought out. This is a plea for anarchy - no laws, no restrictions, just might-makes-right free will.

Restrictions exist in a society for a reason. Different people will have different views on what the restrictions should be. Argue the restriction, not a straw man [22].

>Is there a waiver somewhere I can sign that says, "I understand the risks, but I choose a life with Hugs and Smiles, and the State Fair and go to Church and go hug my Mom in her retirement home.

Nope, just like there is not waiver I can sign that says "I understand that I might pay a little more in taxes, but I would prefer to not use our current insurance system and instead give healthcare as a basic human right for the richest nation on the planet." Unfortunately for both of us, we are in this together.

>I understand that there is a minuscule possibility I could die, but I will most likely end up feeling like crap for a few days.
>I understand I could possibly pass it to someone else, if I'm not careful, but I can pass any virus onto someone else.

And with this statement, this person reveals that they don't really get it. This is not like any other virus. If it was, we (the collective world 'we') would not be reacting like we are. It is very different, and requires a different level of response.

Winning the lottery is miniscule. A 1:1000 death rate is not miniscule.

>I'm struggling to see where or how this ends.

With a vaccine, we covered this.

>We either get busy living or we get busy dying.

Logical fallacy [19]

>I would rather spend my time enjoying it and living in the moment and not worrying about what ifs and maybes, and I bet I'm not the only one. I’ll sign that waiver!!!
>Amen!!

This rant as a whole gets to why I am irritated with conservatives in general. It follows the "me and mine" mentality - nobody matters except for me and my family. People who subscribe to this way of thinking discount human lives as less valuable. Refugees being denied asylum and send back to their home country? Well I've never met them so it doesn't matter that they are being killed. Children are being separated from their families at the border? Well my kids are safe in bed, so I don't see what that has to do with me. Thousands of people are dying every day from COVID? Well I'll probably recover, so that's not an issue for me.

The lack of empathy for the other really bothers me. It saddens me to see people dismiss the lives of others as numbers on a page, or the trauma of real ER nurses seeing patients die day after day.

You are not being persecuted. You are not an Uighur in China. Stay at home and read a book. Save lives. Real lives. Real people who could live to see another of their granddaughter's softball games if we work together to make the world safer for them while we bend biochemistry to our will, strip this virus down to its genetic sequence, make it our bitch, and roll out a life saving miracle. The best kind of miracle because it's repeatable and we know how it works.

The end is in sight now. Stay strong.

# Vampire -
## Skills
- Shrewd Negotiation
- Access to many places on delivery
- An eye for detail

## Resources
- A fine rug with a flaw that makes it un-sellable.
- A blessed sword from the east; a gift from Puri.
- Many contacts that travel the world (other, traveling merchents).

## Characters
### Mortal
- Antilli Sextus - My father, a textile mechant.
- Puri Dontus - My favorite trader, always has enthralling stories of his travels.
- Gaus Frano - Rival merchant, and dirty cheat.

### Immortal
- Quintus Pirus - cousin to the reagent. Enjoys all the wealth with none of the responcibility.

## Marks
- When my emotions get hightened, my teeth become large fangs, my eyes turn black, and the blood vessels turn a vibrant blue. I must control myself at all times.
- My right arm bears a scratch that glows faintly in the dark. I blame the scratch on a wild dog and keep it covered always.

## Memory 3
### Experience 1
Gaus Frano replaces one of our rugs in our cart, we don't notice until we return home. The new rug is made of a fine material, but has a flaw in the pattern so obvious nobody in thier right mind would buy it. Just another reason to hate Gaus.

## Memory 5
### Experience 1
I stuble upon Quintus Pirus crouched over a corpse. His teeth are large and sharp as a wolf's. His face is covered in blood. He sees me and lunges, scratching my arm as I pull out my sword to defend myself. The sword falls from my hand and clatters, grazing his leg. He screams and runs faster than I ever thought possible. I awoke with his curse.
